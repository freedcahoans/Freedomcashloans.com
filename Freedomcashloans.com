The amount you can borrow varies according to your state’s laws and your finances, but a payday loan is typically $500 or less.

This doesn’t mean you’ll be approved for the highest amount allowed by law. A payday lender may consider your income when deciding how much you can borrow. However, other payday lenders may not evaluate your ability to repay, or your other obligations, leaving you at risk for financially overextending yourself.
